# CESS: The Decentralized Data Infrastructure 

Traditional independent storage media suffer from inherent limitations in reliability, accessibility, and scalability. To address these shortcomings, centralized cloud storage solutions have gained widespread adoption, enabling ubiquitous data access and elastic capacity expansion. However, over-centralization introduces systemic weaknesses, including security risks such as data leakage, corruption, and unauthorized tampering, censorship vulnerabilities, and the erosion of data sovereignty. Moreover, centralized architectures promote the formation of data silos and reduce interoperability. Ensuring secure, verifiable, and censorship-resistant data storage has therefore become a critical challenge that demands a structural redesign of the storage paradigm.

To overcome these issues, the CESS Network implements a blockchain-based decentralized data infrastructure known as CESS Storage, which preserves the scalability and accessibility of traditional cloud storage while eliminating the single points of failure inherent to centralized infrastructures. This constitutes the first foundational phase of the CESS system.
