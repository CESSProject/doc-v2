# Decentralized consistency guarantee
As a decentralized distributed system, blockchain uses cryptographic protocols to maintain the consistency of the entire system collaboratively. Byzantine attacks occur when attackers control multiple authorized nodes in a communication network and interfere with or disrupt the network, preventing blockchain nodes from reaching a consensus. On the CESS platform, managing on-chain data may encounter scenarios where nodes maliciously attempt to tamper with or erase data.

To address these challenges, the CESS platform incorporates a hybrid and efficient consensus module. The [Random Rotational Selection (R²S)](https://doc.cess.network/ref/in-depth-feat/rrc) consensus mechanism ensures security and system activity as long as the number of Byzantine (malicious) nodes does not exceed a specific threshold. Specifically, when there are f Byzantine nodes in the system, the entire network must maintain at least 3f + 1 replica nodes to ensure that correct decisions are made across the network. This design effectively prevents malicious behavior from being uploaded to the chain, safeguarding the integrity of on-chain data.
