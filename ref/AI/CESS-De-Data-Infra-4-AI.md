#### 4. **Proof of Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR²)**

CESS introduces the world’s first blockchain-based disaster recovery system that can withstand the loss of up to 60% of its nodes. Known as **Proof of Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR²)**, this mechanism ensures that data is always recoverable, even in the event of node failure or disaster. 

**Key Benefits**:

- **High Availability**: CESS ensures data is highly available and resilient. Even under extreme conditions, the system guarantees data recovery, which is especially crucial for AI applications that rely on large, critical datasets.

- **Blockchain-Backed Integrity**: The PoDR² system guarantees the integrity of stored data by using blockchain to track redundancy and recovery processes. This ensures that AI models can always access the most up-to-date and accurate data, even during system failures.
