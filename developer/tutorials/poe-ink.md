![Ink! 4.0](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/ink-4.0.svg)

# Objective

In this tutorial, we will walk through a full dApp development experience, write out both the smart contract, based on [Ink!](https://use.ink/) and the frontend, based on [React](https://react.dev/). Then we will deploy the smart contract on the CESS development node/chain, and have the frontend interact with it.

The application that we will develop is a Proof of Existence (PoE) dApp. It is used to prove that: 1) one is the owner of a certain file, and 2) the file has exactly the same content as it was when being published on-chain in the past (think to prove the content of a contract has not been tampered with).

We will use a simple logic to do this. We extract the first 64kB of the file content, pass it as the input to a hash function to get its digest, and then check if the digest has been recorded on-chain before. Users can also send a transaction on-clain to claim that he own the file with that digest.

The complete source code of this tutorial can be cloned/seen at:<br/><https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/tree/main/examples/poe-ink>

It contains both the smart contract (inside `contract` directory) and front end (inside `frontend` directory) code.


{% endhint %}

We will first code the smart contract (Ink!) side, and then the frontend side. Let's jump right in.

# Smart Contract (Ink!)

## Prerequisites

This section the same prerequsites as the tutorial [Deploy an Ink! Smart Contract](./deploy-sc-ink.md#prerequisite). Please follow that section and install all required components: Rust and `cargo-contract`.

## Development

1. Let's start by building the directory structure

    ```bash
    mkdir poe-ink
    cd poe-ink
    cargo contract new contract
    ```

    The last command will create an Ink! contract project skeleton.

    Inside the directory there are three files.

    ```
    - .gitignore: files to ignore when commiting to git
    - Cargo.toml: This is a Rust project, so there is a `Cargo.toml` file for the project specification.
    - lib.rs: the actual contract code and unit test code.
    ```

    The most interesting file is `lib.rs`. Please skim through it to get an idea. It is a simple contract that read and flip a boolean value.

2. Let's build and test the contract project.

    ```bash
    cd contract          # In case you haven't get inside the contract dir.
    cargo contract build # This command builds the contract project.
    cargo test           # This command run the unit test code starting at the `mod tests` line in the code.
    ```

    Running the `cargo contract build` yields three files:

    - `contract.wasm`: the contract code
    - `contract.json`: the contract metadata
    - `contract.contract`: the contract code and metadata

    The frontend (see next section) will need to read `contract.json` to know the API of the contract. We will use `contract.contract` to instantiate the contract on-chain.

3. Open `lib.rs`, let's remove everything and only keep the top level structure. So we have:

    ```rs
    #![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

    #[ink::contract]
    mod contract {
      // we will fill up the code here next
    }
    ```

4. In smart contract development, two of the keys are how the storage data structure look like, and what events it emit. So thinking about the PoE functionality we will need a map from user addresss to an array of files, indicated by the hash digest, they owned, and a reverse map from the hash digest to its owner. Let's also specify that a file can only be owned by at most one user only. The following storage structure support it:

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // The following two lines are added to import the support of vector `Vec` and `Mapping` data structure.
      use ink::prelude::{vec, vec::Vec};
      use ink::storage::Mapping;

      #[ink(storage)]
      pub struct Contract {
        /// Mapping from AccountId to hash of files the user owned
        users: Mapping<AccountId, Vec<Hash>>,
        /// Mapping from the file hash to its owner
        files: Mapping<Hash, AccountId>,
      }
    }
    ```

    We use `#[ink(storage)]` attribute macro to tell Rust compiler this is the smart contract storage, and the compiler will further process the storage specification here. [Check here](https://github.com/paritytech/ink#ink-macros--attributes-overview) to learn more about the macros ink! used.

5. Now we want our smart contract to emit events when a user successfully claim the file ownership. Let's also allow the user to forfeit the claim in future. So the two events are:

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // ... below the storage data structure code

      #[ink(event)]
      pub struct Claimed {
        #[ink(topic)]
        owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        file: Hash,
      }

      #[ink(event)]
      pub struct Forfeited {
        #[ink(topic)]
        owner: AccountId,
        #[ink(topic)]
        file: Hash,
      }
    }
    ```

    We specify two events:
    - **Claimed**: when the event is emitted, the associated user and the file digest are also emitted.
    - **Forfeit**: same as above, the associated user and the file digest are also emitted.

6. Let work on the core logic of the smart contract

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // ... below the event code

      impl Contract {
        /// Constructor to initialize the contract
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
          let users = Mapping::default();
          let files = Mapping::default();
          Self { users, files }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn owned_files(&self) -> Vec<Hash> {
          let from = self.env().caller();
          self.users.get(from).unwrap_or(Vec::<Hash>::new())
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn has_claimed(&self, file: Hash) -> bool {
          match self.files.get(file) {
            Some(_) => true,
            None => false,
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Here we have defined three methods:

    - `fn new()`: the smart contract constructor. This is the function that will be called when the smart contract is instantiated. It is marked with `#[ink(constructor)]` right above the function.

    - `fn owned_files(&self)`: This function returns a vector, Rust way of saying an array, of Hash. It first retrieves the caller of the smart contract, uses it as the key to retrieve its value inside the **`users`** storage map, and returns the value. If no value is found by the key, an empty vector is returned.

        Notice this function doesn't take an `AccountId` parameter in, so the caller can only checks its own file ownership but not others.

    - `fn has_claimed(&self, file: Hash)`: The function returns a boolean, indicating if the file, specified by the hash, has been claimed by some user. We read from the smart contract storage **`files`**, using the file hash as the key and see if an owner can be retrieved. If yes, the file is claimed and the function returns true. Otherwise, returns false.

        Notice we haven't specified what hash function to use and how a file is converted to its hash digest. This is actually the job of the frontend so we will take care of this in the next section.

7. Now let's work on the core logic of `fn claim()`, a user claiming the ownership of a certain file. The overall logic is that:

    - we first check the file hasn't been claimed before.
    - we update the storage `files` and `users` to indicate the caller has claimed the file ownership
    - emit an event that the file has been claimed so blockchain listeners know about this.

    The following code entails the above logics:

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // ...previous code
      impl Contract {
        // ...previous code

        /// A message to claim the ownership of the file hash
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn claim(&mut self, file: Hash) -> Result<()> {
          // Get the caller
          let from = self.env().caller();

          // Check the hash hasn't been claimed yet
          if self.files.contains(file) {
            return Err(Error::AlreadyClaimed);
          }

          // Claim the file hash ownership with two write ops
          // Update the `users` storage. If a vector is retrieved, we push the hash digest into
          //   the vector. Otherwise we create a new vector with the hash digest element inside.
          match self.users.get(from) {
            Some(mut files) => {
              // A user entry has already been built
              files.push(file);
              self.users.insert(from, &files);
            }
            None => {
              // A user entry hasn't been built, so building one here
              self.users.insert(from, &vec![file]);
            }
          }

          // Update the `files` storage
          self.files.insert(file, &from);

          // Emit an event
          Self::env().emit_event(Claimed { owner: from, file });

          Ok(())
        }
      }
    }
    ```

8. You may have noticed the return value type of `fn claim()` look different from the two previous functions `fn owned_files()` and `fn has_claimed()`. `fn owned_files()` and `fn has_claimed()` are view functions, and they only read the contract status/storage but doesn't alter it. `fn claim()` on the other hand is a state modifying function. It returns a [`Result` enum type in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) to indicate whether the function successfully change the state by returning `Ok(())`, or an error occurs and state is not changed at all `Err(error value here)`. In fact, the result is a short hand to a longer form that we will see later in the code.

    Now, let's define the longer form of Result and the error values. Two error values are going to emitted in our contract, when a user try to claim a file that has already been claimed, `AlreadyClaimed`; and when users trying to forfeit the file ownership of a file they don't own, `NotOwner`.

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // ... prev code

      // Beware this part of the code is OUTSIDE of `impl Contract {}`, unlike the claim() function above.

      // Result type used in `fn claim()` is a short form.
      pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;

      // These are two error values returned in our contract
      #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)]
      #[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
      pub enum Error {
        /// File with the specified hash has been claimed by another user
        AlreadyClaimed,
        /// Caller doesn't own the file with the specified hash
        NotOwner,
      }

      impl Contract {
        // ... prev code
      }
    }
    ```

9. Regarding the `fn forfeit()` function, it is basically reversing the above `fn claim()` operation in the above step.

    - we first check the caller actually own the file. If not we return an error
    - we update the **`users`** and **`files`** storage to remove the file hash digest
    - emit an event about this new state.

    ```rs
    mod contract {
      // ...previous code
      impl Contract {
        // ...previous code
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn forfeit(&mut self, file: Hash) -> Result<()> {
          let from = self.env().caller();

          // Check if the file is owned by the caller. If not, returns `Error::NotOwner`.
          match self.files.get(file) {
            Some(owner) => {
              if owner != from {
                return Err(Error::NotOwner);
              }
            }
            None => {
              return Err(Error::NotOwner);
            }
          }

          // Confirmed the caller is the file owner. Update the two storage `users` and `files`.
          let mut files = self.users.get(from).unwrap_or(vec![]);
          for idx in 0..files.len() {
            if files[idx] == file {
              files.swap_remove(idx);
              self.users.insert(from, &files);
            }
          }

          self.files.remove(file);

          // Emit an event
          Self::env().emit_event(Forfeited { owner: from, file });

          Ok(())
        }
      }
    }
    ```

10. By this point, you have completed all the core logic of the smart contract. Compile the contract with `cargo contract build` to ensure it builds. You can always refer back to the [**full source code**](https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/blob/main/examples/poe-ink/contract/lib.rs).

11. After the compilation, try to [deploy the contract on your local cess dev chain](./deploy-sc-ink.md) and interact with the contract to test it out. You can connect to [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/) that connect to your local node and deploy the contract. See the screenshot below.

    ![Deploy PoE Ink! Contract](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/deploy-poe-contract.png)

    Ensure that:

    - Contracts UI is connecting to the local CESS node.
    - You see the expected metadata when uploading the `contract.contract` file.

**Congratulation**! You have completed the smart contract development section. Before heading to the frontend, the full source code also contains the unit test code, the code block inside `mod tests { ... }`. We won't go over them here and they are pretty self-explanatory. Please take a look. You can run them by `cargo test`. [Check here](https://use.ink/basics/contract-testing) to learn more about contract testing.

# Front End

## Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Install [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Run a local development chain of the CESS node because the front end will connect to the local CESS chain. Refer here on [how to run a local CESS chain](./deploy-sc-ink.md#deploy-a-smart-contract).

We will start from a modified version of [Substrate Front End Template](https://github.com/hkwtf/substrate-frontend-template). This is the Parity maintained [Substrate Front End Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) using the latest React, Polkadot.js API (as of 2023 Sep) library, and a much faster package manager [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
cd poe-ink    # this is the root directory created during the smart contract development above.
git clone https://github.com/hkwtf/substrate-frontend-template.git frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install  # pull all the project dependencies down

# Before starting the front end below, open another terminal window and start your local CESS node.
# Refer to ./deploy-sc-ink.md#deploy-a-smart-contract

pnpm start    # start the project
```

If you see a screen similar to the following, you are good to go.

![Substrate Front End Template](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/substrate-frontend-template.png)

## Before We Start

First of all, in case there is any doubt, you can always refer back to [**the full front end source code**](https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/tree/main/examples/poe-ink/frontend).on the

To get a high level understand of the frontend template, let's refer to the second self section of `src/App.js`:

```jsx
function Main() {
  // ...code snapped
  return (
    <div ref={contextRef}>
      <Sticky context={contextRef}>
        <AccountSelector />
      </Sticky>
      <Container>
        <Grid stackable columns="equal">
          <Grid.Row stretched>
            <NodeInfo />
            <Metadata />
            <BlockNumber />
            <BlockNumber finalized />
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row stretched>
            <Balances />
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row>
            <Transfer />
            <Upgrade />
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row>
            <Interactor />
            <Events />
          </Grid.Row>
          <Grid.Row>
            <TemplateModule />
          </Grid.Row>
        </Grid>
      </Container>
      <DeveloperConsole />
    </div>
  );
}
```
Here you see how different components are laid out on the screen.

![Substrate Front End Template Components](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/substrate-fe-tpl-sectioned.png)

1. The `<AccountSelector/>` component, refering to `src/AccountSelector.js` file.
2. The `<NodeInfo />` component, referring to `src/NodeInfo.js` file.
3. The `<Metadata />` component, referring to `src/Metadata.js` file.
4. The `<Balances />` component, referring to `src/Balances.js` file.

We will add a new component and show case how to use [**useink**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/useink) library connecting the front end to the smart contract.

## Development

1. Add the **useink** dependencies by:

    ```bash
    pnpm install useink
    ```

2. In `src/App.js`, let's replace the `<TemplateModule />` component with `<PoEWithInkProvider />`. Remove the `TemplateModule` import line and add back `PoEWithInkProvider`. We also create a basic React skeleton of `src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js`.

    So, `src/App.js` becomes:

    ```jsx
    // Remove/comment out this line
    // import TemplateModule from "./TemplateModule";
    // Add the following line
    import PoEWithInkProvider from "./ProofOfExistenceInk";

    //... code snapped
    return (
      <div ref={contextRef}>
        { /* code snapped */ }
        <Container>
          <Grid stackable columns="equal">
            {/* code snapped */}
            <Grid.Row>
              <PoEWithInkProvider />
            </Grid.Row>
          </Grid>
        </Container>
        {/* code snapped */}
      </div>
    )
    ```

    The file `src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js` looks like the following:

    ```jsx
    import { React, useState } from "react";

    export default function PoEWithInkProvider(props) {
      return (<>Proof of Existence Ink! dApp</>);
    }
    ```

    At this point, the front end should work with the line "Proof of Existence Ink! dApp" shown.

3. From now on, we will mainly focus on the file `src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js`. We will not adding code line by line here, but we will cover the APIs provided by **useink** library that facilitate ink! smart contract interaction.

    Refer to the code [`src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js`](https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/blob/main/examples/poe-ink/frontend/src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js).

4. Starting from [the bottom](https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/blob/main/examples/poe-ink/frontend/src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js#L186-L195), we have:

    ```jsx
    <UseInkProvider
      config={{
        dappName: "Proof of Existence (Ink)",
        chains: [{ id: "custom", name: "CESS localhost", rpcs: [config.PROVIDER_SOCKET] }],
      }}
    >
      <ProofOfExistenceInk />
    </UseInkProvider>
    ```

    `UseInkProvider` context hook is used to provide !ink contract connection information to its children components. A config object is passed in with the name, and:

    - `chains.id`: there are public chains with well-known IDs. As we are connecting to a local development chain, we set it to `custom`.
    - `chain.name`: the name of the chain. It will be displayed when prompting for wallet connection.
    - `chain.rpcs`: we get this value from the app config, which points to a local chain RPC endpoint, `wss://localhost:9944`.

    We can call ink! API call inside `<ProofOfExistenceInk />` component.

5. Looking at the code inside [`function ProofOfExistenceInk(props) {...}`](https://github.com/hkwtf/cess-course/blob/main/examples/poe-ink/frontend/src/ProofOfExistenceInk.js#L31-L100)

    ```jsx
    function ProofOfExistenceInk(props) {
      const { account } = useWallet();

      const balance = useBalance(account);

      // Getting the contract API
      const poeContract = useContract(CONTRACT_ADDR, metadata, "custom");
      const ownedFiles = useCallSubscription(poeContract, "ownedFiles");
      const ownedFilesRes = pickDecoded(ownedFiles.result);

      //... code snapped
    }
    ```

    - Use `useWallet()` to get the current smart-contract connecting account.
    - Use `useBalance(account)` to get the current balance of the account.
    - Use `useContract(CONTRACT_ADDR, metadata, "custom")` to get the contract ABI.
        - The contract address `CONTRACT_ADDR` is specified above. So everytime when a new PoE contract is deployed, we need to update the address value assigned.
        - `metadata` is specified above too, coming from the metadata json file when we `cargo contract build` our smart contract.
        - `custom` is the chain ID where the contract is deployed.

        At this point we have a contract instance `poeContract` that we can interact with.
    - We then use `useCallSubscription()` to subscribe to the value returning from `ownedFiles()` function from the smart contract. Recall from the previous section that this function returns all the file hash digests the user account owned.
    - Then we use `pickDecoded()` method to decode the result, converting from the chain data types to javascript data types.

    All the functions mentioned here are provided by **useink**.

6. Here we specify how the file hash digest is computed.

    ```jsx
    const computeFileHash = (file) => {
      const fileReader = new FileReader();
      fileReader.onloadend = (e) => {
        // We extract only the first 64kB  of the file content
        const typedArr = new Uint8Array(fileReader.result.slice(0, 65536));
        setFileHash(blake2AsHex(typedArr));
      };
      fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
    };
    ```

    We use [`FileReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) provided by modern day browser JS API to read the uploaded file, extract the first 64 kB, and use `blake2AsHex()` [Blake2 cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE2) to calculate its hash digest, provided by [**@polkadot/util-crypto**](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/util-crypto/examples/hash-data) library.

7. We then also implement a few helper components **TxButton**, **ConnectWallet**, and **WalletSwitcher** to display the UI.

    - **TxButton** component sends either `claim()` or `forfeit()` transaction to the chain depending on whether the user owned the file. It uses `useTx()` to construct the transaction and use `signAndSend()` method to send the transaction.

    - **ConnectWallet** component allows user to switch from different wallet provider, including Enkrypt, Polkadot.js extension, SubWallet, and Talisman. A typical choice would be to use [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

        ![Different wallet provider](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/wallet-type.png)

        It uses `useWallet()` to get the wallet connection function and `useAllWallets()` to get the information of all supported wallets.

    - **WalletSwitcher** component retrieve all available accounts provided by the wallet chosen in **ConnectWallet**, using the `accounts` object. It also use `setAccount()` to set a particular account and `disconnect()` to disconnect from the chosen wallet.

8. Finally we have a front end similar to the following:

    ![PoE Front end](../../assets/developer/tutorials/poe-ink/full-frontend.png)

# Tutorial Completion

**Congratulation**! Let's recap what we have done:

- You have successfully implemented a PoE logic in ink! smart contract and deploy it on a local CESS node.
- You have successfully implemented the front end that interact with the smart contract, start with the foundation from Substrate Front End Template with **useink** React library.

Now, you can build your own dApp and deploy it on CESS testnet to test it out. You may also want to learn about how to [develop a dApp with Solidity smart contract](./poe-solidity.md) as well.
