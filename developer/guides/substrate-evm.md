# Background

CESS network is a Substrate-based network. But the network also allows developers to deploy solidity contracts and run them on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This capability is empowered by **EVM Pallet** and **Ethereum Pallet** implemented by [Parity Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier).

Substrate by default is using [SS58 address type](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-advanced). It is a modification of Base-58-check from Bitcoin with some minor changes. Notably, the format contains an address type prefix that identifies an address belonging to a specific network.

# EVM Integration in Substrate

Before diving in the address conversion scheme, let's take a look on what is causing the needs of this address conversion.

Within Substrate architecture, the [**EVM Pallet**](https://docs.rs/crate/pallet-evm/5.0.0) is a separate Substrate pallet with its own accounts and balances that only shares the block state as the host Substrate blockchain, represented as below:

![Substrate EVM Architecture](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/substrate-evm-arch.webp)

There are a couple of points to note here:

- The EVM environment works on top of Substrate. This means that the block height of the EVM depends on the host Substrate network and the host Substrate network will be able to access the EVM state, but the EVM will not be able to access or mutate the host Substrate networkâ€™s state through normal means.

- The EVM environment exposes its own RPC endpoint. The endpoint can be exposed by implementing the Frontier RPC client and the endpoint is EIP-1474 compatible, which means tools and sites that work with Ethereum will be fully compatible with the EVM environment within Substrate. You can use MetaMask to connect to the network and view or send tokens like you would on other Ethereum-compatible chains.

- The EVM environment has its own balance called the EVM deposit, which can be withdrawn by Substrate native accounts. A native Substrate SS58 address can be converted to an H160 address that is mapped to an EVM deposit, and an EVM H160 address can be converted to an SS58 address. This allows the accounts to transfer tokens from the native balance to an EVM balance, and vice versa. But we will need to convert between addresses here to achieve the transfer.

# Substrate and EVM Address Conversion

So Substrate address is generated as followed:

![Substrate Address](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/substrate-addr.png)

The account ID is 32 bytes long.

On the other hand, EVM-compatible address is 20 bytes long. It is generated in the following way:

![EVM Address](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/evm-addr.png)

Notice the last cryptographic hash function used is different. So in order to support EVM in a Substrate-based network, there is a mechanism for converting the address and be able to transfer balances between them.


![Address Conversion](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/addr-conversion.png)

Referring to the above diagram. Let's start with #1, **Substrate Signing Account**. This is the signing account you used when connecting to CESS node to sign transaction. This is your your main Substrate account holding your balance. This Substrate account has an equivalent EVM-mapping address. It is done by calculating the pubic key of the user from its SS58 address and extract the first 20 bytes of it.

So with the well-known development account of `Alice`. It is actually an account generated from mnemonic:

```
bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
```

It has the following attributes for CESS testnet

- Secret seed/priv key: `0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a`
- Account ID/pub key:   `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d`
- SS58 Address:         `cXjmuHdBk4J3Zyt2oGodwGegNFaTFPcfC48PZ9NMmcUFzF6cc`

Its EVM-mapped address (#4 of the above diagram) of the Substrate signing account will be the first 20 bytes of the Account ID, `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558`.

---
Let's talk about the right-hand side now. We also have an EVM signing account. A question you will ask is if we can import the above EVM-mapped address into our EVM wallet app. Unfortunately the answer is **NO**. It is because we don't know the private key that generate the EVM-mapped address. Using the `Alice` secret seed/private key above and importing it to an EVM wallet doesn't get us an equivalent EVM-mapped address but another new address. This is because the public key generation mechanism.

So we need another new EVM account here. To make thing simple, we will just import the secret seed of `Alice` development account (just bear in mind this is a totally separate account) to get our EVM signing account.

We will get an EVM signing account of `0x8097c3C354652CB1EEed3E5B65fBa2576470678A` (#3).

To get the Substrate-mapped address, we will use the [Substrate EVM Address Converter](https://hoonsubin.github.io/evm-substrate-address-converter/) developed by [Hoon Kim](https://github.com/hoonsubin).

Heading to the page, we set the address scheme to **H160**, input the network ID as **11330** (the chain ID of CESS Testnet), and set the input address, we will get the Substrate-mapped address at the bottom. It is **cXgEvnbJfHsaN8HfoiEWfAi4QBENYbLKitRfG1CDYZpKTRRuw** (2nd diagram #2).

Now that we have the four accounts, we can transfer CESS tokens back and forth between Account Set 1 and Account Set 2.

# Transfer from a Substrate Account to an Evm Account and Back

Recall the addresses we will be using

Account Set 1:
- Substrate signing addr: **cXjmuHdBk4J3Zyt2oGodwGegNFaTFPcfC48PZ9NMmcUFzF6cc** (#1)
- EVM-mapped addr: **0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558** (#4)

Account Set 2:
- Substrate-mapped addr: **cXgEvnbJfHsaN8HfoiEWfAi4QBENYbLKitRfG1CDYZpKTRRuw** (#2)
- EVM signing addr: **0x8097c3C354652CB1EEed3E5B65fBa2576470678A** (#3)

1. Connecting to your CESS local node in [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts). Development account `Alice` should have 100 MUnit of tokens.

![1-initial-acct](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/1-initial-acct.png)

2. Connect your EVM wallet to CESS local node. In the following example we will use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). First, add CESS Local network in Metamask using the following info:

    - Network Name: **CESS Localhost**
    - RPC URL: **http://localhost:9944**
    - Chain ID: **11330**
    - Currency Symbol: **TCESS**
    - Block explorer URL: leave it as blank

3. After adding the network, import a new account in Metamask with the following private key:

    `0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a`

    Now you should see an account with account ID `0x8097c3C354652CB1EEed3E5B65fBa2576470678A` in which it has 0 balance. This is our EVM signing address (#3)

    ![3-initial-status](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/3-initial-status.png)



3. We will transfer 10M token unit from `Alice` (#1) to the Substrate-mapped address `cXgEvnbJfHsaN8HfoiEWfAi4QBENYbLKitRfG1CDYZpKTRRuw` (#2)

![1-to-2 Transfer](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/1-to-2-transfer.png)

3. Once transferred and waited a few seconds, opening your EVM wallet and you should see the balance of the EVM account is updated to reflect the transfer.

    On the native account (#1):

    ![after-1st-transfer-native](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/after-1st-transfer-native.png)

    On the EVM account (#3):

    ![after-1st-transfer-evm](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/after-1st-transfer-evm.png)

4. Let's transfer some ERC-20 TCESS tokens back and withdraw it in our Substrate signing account. In the EVM wallet app, transfer 3 TCESS back to the EVM-mapped address `0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558` (#4).

    ![Transfer ERC-20 Tokens](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/transfer-erc20.png)

5. Now on the Polkadot.js App side, let's use `Alice` account to issue an extrinsics `evm.withdraw` to withdraw the ERC-20 token out and convert it back to the chain native tokens. Put the following as parameters:

    - address: our EVM-mapped address: **0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558**
    - value: the amount to withdraw, **2500000000000000000**.

    ![Issue `evm.withdraw()` Extrinsic](../../assets/developer/guides/substrate-evm/evm-withdraw-extrinsic.png)


6. After the extrinsic is processed, you should see Alice account is updated, from 90M unit to 92M unit.
