There are times we find helpful tools and libraries when working on blockchain projects and then we stick with them. We list them here, and hopefully you will find them helpful when working on your own blockchain projects.

Note that the CESS blockchain is built on top of Substrate blockchain SDK. Users can deploy both ink! smart contracts and EVM-compatible smart contracts on CESS blockchain.
