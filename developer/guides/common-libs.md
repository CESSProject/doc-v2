There are times we find ourselves returning to the same set of tools and libraries when we work on blockchain projects. We list them here, and hopefully you will find them helpful when working on your blockchain projects.

Note that the CESS blockchain is built on top of Substrate blockchain SDK. Users can deploy both ink! smart contracts and EVM-compatible smart contracts on the CESS blockchain.
