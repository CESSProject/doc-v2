This section focuses on the details of the implementation of the storage network and its utilisation. The Storage Network is a decentralised P2P network whose composition consists of a large group of storage miners working together. This network aims to provide an efficient and secure data storage solution by decentralising data storage and retrieval mechanisms and storing data on various nodes in the network in a decentralised manner, thus achieving high data reliability and availability. In this network, storage miners play a key role by providing storage space and obtaining corresponding rewards by contributing storage resources.

Please refer to [p2p-go](https://github.com/CESSProject/p2p-go) for the source code. For more information, see [API documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CESSProject/p2p-go).
