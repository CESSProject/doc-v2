# ðŸ”¨ Use Cases

## 1. NFT Issuance and Storage

NFT can often involve large, high-resolution images or even 3D models that traditionally required expensive centralized storage. This creates a single point of failure and goes against the principles of decentralization. However, CESS provides an ideal solution for securely storing NFT assets.

NFT developers and/or owners now only need to upload NFT files and CESS will verify and confirm ownersâ€™ data rights using the Multi-format Data Rights Confirmation Mechanism (MDRC), and then distribute the data files to storage nodes. Data is then properly indexed and distributed to facilitate both the public visits and private safe retrieval of the NFTs.

For example, if an American artist creates an NFT artwork and sells it to a UK buyer online through CESS, the copyright transfer and time-stamping of the transaction will be executed transparently and remain permanently trackable, as intrinsically guaranteed by CESS blockchain technology. The new owner of the NFT (i.e., the UK buyer) will be automatically and uniquely issued an encrypted code (i.e., private key) upon the completion of online transaction. Meanwhile, the old private key held by the American artist will automatically become obsolete.

## 2. Decentralized Data Marketplace

CESS offers two types of smart contracts to users with different pricing models. When users
upload data files, they get to choose its values. CESS generates data file attributes based on user inputs. The data attributes include pricing model type, access control list, etc... Data
attributes are published together with user data. Whenever a data file is retrieved, based on data file
attributes, the system checks if the accessors have permission to retrieve the files. If yes, the system will issue charges to buyers based on data file pricing models, and then start the data download.

On CESS platform, all data file retrieval records are recorded on blockchain and hence are backward traceable. The CESS data rights protection mechanism maintains a recording module to allow users to view their data file retrieval records, providing strong evidence for user data rights protection.

## 3. Distributed Enterprise Storage Service

As a decentralized cloud storage system with a tremendous amount of storage resource pool, CESS meets the demand of enterprise data storage service perfectly. CESS storage network is built on blockchain technology with multiple storage proof mechanisms. This make the system provide a fast, secure storage solution at a lower cost compared to centralized storage providers. Enterprises can also utilize CESS for their data archival and backup.

## 4. Decentralized Streaming and Social Media

There is a genuine concern about articles and videos being subjected to censorship by large corporations and governments. By utilizing CESS and incorporating blockchain-written metadata, storing such content ensures its resistance to censorship, safeguarding data integrity and freedom of speech.

## 5. Personal Network Drive

CESS offers distributed network drive to end users, so individual can securely store personal data such as photos and documents in it. Compared to traditional network drives, CESS has significant advantages on security, ownership protection, cost, and capacity. CESS disks do not require cloud servers, effectively avoiding dependency on centralized servers. Instead, user data are stored in multiple peer-to-peer (p2p) storage nodes.

By adopting blockchain-based cryptographic algorithms to encrypt stored data, CESS ensures the privacy of user data without worrying about data loss or central server outages.
