# üßê What is CESS

## WHAT is CESS?

Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (**CESS**) is a revolutionary solution for secure and private storage of data. Developed with the aim of providing users with full control over their data, CESS ensures that data remains encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. In this article, we will delve into the what, why, and how of CESS, exploring its features and benefits, as well as providing relevant examples.

## WHY CESS?

CESS is the first decentralized storage for large-scale enterprise-level, enabling users to securely store their data in an encrypted format. It utilizes advanced encryption techniques to ensure that only the authorized user can access the data, providing end-to-end privacy and security. CESS is also an open-source and public blockchain intended to be the underlying infrastructure for decentralized storage needs. By leveraging blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, CESS eliminates the need for a centralized authority, making it resistant to censorship and tampering.

CESS is also compatible with both EVM and Wasm. The underlying blockchain framework Substrate allows cross-ecosystem, cross-chain applications to use CESS. Its technology stack supports most Web3 applications and the storage needs of enterprise-level applications.

## HOW does CESS work?

CESS consists of four layers: the **Blockchain Layer**, **Storage Resource Layer**, **Content Delivery Layer**, and **Application Layer**. CESS consensus mechanism coordinates the network resources and network load. It guarantees data security and integrity through proprietary technologies with data ownership protection, Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR¬≤), Multi-format Data Rights Confirmation (MDRC), and Proxy Re-encryption Technology (PReT).

CESS leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored within the system. When a user store data on CESS, it is broken down into smaller encrypted fragments and then distributed across multiple nodes within the network. To access the data, the user needs to authenticate themselves and retrieve the encrypted fragments from the network. The fragments are combined and decrypted locally on the user's device, ensuring that the data is never exposed in its entirety during the retrieval process. This distributed and encrypted storage mechanism provides a high level of security and privacy, safeguarding the user's data from unauthorized access.

## Project Vision and Roadmap

Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (CESS) aims to realize a transparent, effective, and fair new decentralized storage system, enabling data collaboration in cross-platform, cross-format interoperability while tracing the data flow with an appropriate revenue-sharing scheme with users. The following are the three phases to achieve this vision ultimately.

**Phase I: Decentralised Cloud Storage** - Build a blockchain-based decentralized cloud storage system, overcoming the centralization issues of traditional cloud storage. This is completed.

**Phase II: Decentralized Content Distribution Layer** - As the p2p storage network expand, a content distribution layer will gradually be established. Data shards are aggregated and cached from users' closest edge nodes during accesses and further reduce transaction fees and improve speed. We will launch an application marketplace ecosystem and push for enterprise adoption.

**Phase III: Decentralized Data Marketplace** - With data ownership authentication feature launched, developers, data contributors, data integrator will be able to mix and match data, discovering more in-depth analytics and insights, and share the revenue through CESS decentralized data marketplace.

## Conclusion

With the increasing concern around data privacy and security, CESS addresses a critical need in today's digital landscape. Traditional storage solutions expose users' data to vulnerabilities and the risk of unauthorized access. By using CESS, users can regain control over their data, knowing that it is encrypted and stored securely. Additionally, CESS promotes decentralization and empowers individuals by removing the reliance on centralized storage providers. The high performance and reliability can also satisfy the enterprise need on storage requirement.

In conclusion, CESS provides a secure and private storage solution for individuals and organizations, enabling them to regain control over their data. By leveraging blockchain technology and advanced encryption, CESS ensures that data remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties. With its decentralized and trustless nature, CESS aligns with the core principles of blockchain and empowers users to protect their data in an increasingly digital world.
