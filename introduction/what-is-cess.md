# When did the story of CESS begin?
Since its inception in **2019**, our team has been a beacon of youthful energy and innovation, hailing from the UK, USA, India, China (Hong Kong), UAE and Argentina. We are a diverse collective of cryptographers, data storage experts, and computer science engineers, united by a common vision to disrupt the status quo. With a passion for making a difference, we are committed to crafting solutions that not only challenge the boundaries of technology but also have the potential to positively impact the world around us. Our mission is to ingrain a prestigious legacy on the digital landscape, one innovative step at a time.

# Why CESS?

CESS is the first large-scale, enterprise-level decentralized storage, enabling users to securely store their data in an encrypted format. It utilizes advanced encryption techniques to ensure that only the authorized users can access the data and provide end-to-end privacy and security. CESS is also an open-source and public blockchain intended to be the underlying infrastructure for decentralized storage needs. By leveraging blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, CESS eliminates the need for a centralized authority, making it resistant to censorship and tampering.

Offering the most optimal Web3 solution for storing and retrieving high-frequency dynamic data, CESS reshapes the value distribution and circulation of data assets whilst ensuring data sovereignty and user privacy.

By utilizing a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) model, CESS drives mass deployment of network nodes globally through incentives.

CESS is also compatible with both EVM and WebAssembly (Wasm). The underlying blockchain framework allows cross-ecosystem, cross-chain applications to use CESS. Its technology stack supports most Web3 applications.

So, why you choose CESS? 

Here's the answer:

**Location-based Storage Selection**

# How does CESS work?

CESS adopts layered and loosely coupled system architecture, which is divided into **CESS Protocol Suite** and **XESS AI Protocol Suite**. 

CESS Protocol Suite includes a **blockchain service layer**, **distributed storage resource layer**, and **distributed content delivery layer**.

The **XESS AI Protocol Suite** leverages advanced AI technologies to enable secure, privacy-preserving collaborative model training across the CESS network. 

The **Interface** provides CLI/RPC/API/SDK interfaces to support data storage service, blockchain service, high-speed content delivery service and AI tools, etc.

CESS guarantees data security and integrity through proprietary technologies with data ownership protection, Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (**PoDR²**), Multi-format Data Rights Confirmation (**MDRC**), and Proxy Re-encryption Technology (**PReT**).

CESS leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored within the system. When a user stores data on CESS, it is broken down into smaller encrypted fragments and then distributed across multiple nodes within the network. To access the data, the user needs to authenticate themselves and retrieve the encrypted fragments from the network. The fragments are combined and decrypted locally on the user's device, ensuring that the data is never exposed in its entirety during the retrieval process. This distributed and encrypted storage mechanism provides a high level of security and privacy, safeguarding user's data from unauthorized access.


# Conclusion

With the increasing concern around data privacy and security, CESS addresses a critical need in today's digital landscape. Traditional storage solutions expose users' data to vulnerabilities and the risk of unauthorized access. By using CESS, users can regain control over their data, knowing that it is encrypted and stored securely. Additionally, CESS promotes decentralization and empowers individuals by removing the reliance on centralized storage providers. The high performance and reliability can also satisfy the enterprise need on storage requirement.

In conclusion, CESS provides a secure and private storage solution for individuals and organizations, enabling them to regain control over their data. By leveraging blockchain technology and advanced encryption, CESS ensures that data remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties. CESS aligns with the core principles of blockchain and empowers users to protect their data in an increasingly digital world.
