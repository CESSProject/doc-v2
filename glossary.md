| Bucket                               | Buckets are containers for storing objects. Each private key/account can manage up to 1,000 storage containers. |
| Decentralized Object Storage Service | Storage service that store user data as object and are accessible via CESS APIs. |
| Object                               | An Object is a basic unit for storing data. Unlike traditional file systems, objects do not have the hierarchical relational structure of a file directory. An object includes data, metadata, and fid. |
| Data | User's data includes but is not limited to high-definition pictures, audio, video, and backup files in websites and applications |
| FID | The file hash used to retrieve an object. The server and user can find an object through Fid without knowing the physical address of the data. It is the globally unique identifier (UID) of the object. |
| Metadata | Metadata is similar to data labels. There is no limit to the type and the number of items on the label, which can be various descriptions of objects. |
