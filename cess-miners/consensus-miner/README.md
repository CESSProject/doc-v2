A **Consensus Miner** is a fundamental role within the CESS ecosystem, responsible for supporting the security and integrity of the CESS network. By running the CESS blockchain client, Consensus Miners participate in the consensus mechanism, helping to validate transactions and secure the decentralized infrastructure.

As key contributors to the network's governance and stability, Consensus Miners play a critical role in maintaining the distributed ledger, ensuring that the data stored within the CESS network is both accurate and tamper-proof. Their activities include validating blocks, verifying the correctness of transactions, and participating in the protocol's decision-making processes, ultimately ensuring the CESS network's overall resilience and scalability.
