# How to Configure Polkadot.js Apps?

You can navigate directly to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc0.cess.cloud%2Fws%2F#/explorer).

If the link fails or you want to connect to the CESS network through another RPC address, you can configure it as follows:

- Navigate to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps).
  
- Click the blue square area in the picture below to open the configuration panel：

    {% hint style="info" %}
    wss://testnet-rpc0.cess.cloud/ws/

    wss://testnet-rpc1.cess.cloud/ws/

    wss://testnet-rpc2.cess.cloud/ws/
    {% endhint %}
