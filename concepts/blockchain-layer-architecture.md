### Blockchain Layer

As shown in Figure 6, the blockchain layer is further divided into six layers: infrastructurelayer, data layer, network layer, consensus layer, incentive layer and application layer. The
infrastructure layer consists of hardware equipment including servers, network hardware andstorage hardware for CESS blockchain. The data layer, which supports scalable data storage, provides various data processing algorithms; The network layer is for node connection, data
transfer. It provides load balancing and P2P network protocols and algorithms; the consensus layer
provides consensus mechanisms on transactions; The
incentive layer is to achieve fair income distribution through smart contracts and other incentive
schemes. The application layer supports DAPPs or APPs developed by third-party developers

#### Infrastructure Layer


In order to support upper layer applications to access storage resources, CESS needs toconstruct stable and reliable infrastructure facilities. According to Figure 6, CESS invites threetypes of global resources to join the network: Server type, Network type and Storage type. Server-type resources focus on computing performance and will carry the computing and taskscheduling tasks. Network-type resources will provide network bandwidth support. In order tosupport users' global undifferentiated data access, CESS will use nodes with high networkbandwidth to construct a content delivery network to accelerate data retrieval. Storage-ty

#### Daya Layer

The data layer stores CESS blockchain data, as well as data files from CESS storage clients. To ensure the security and integrity of user data files, encryption algorithms are used for data
transmission, storage and verification, such as digital signatures, hash algorithms, Merkle trees, and etc

Block data: Chain data that records transactions over the entire public chain network. Some
nodes need to save block data and run the whole node to ensure the security and stability of the
public chain.

Distributed stor age: Stores data on geographically distributed devices. It provides efficient, robust and load balanced file access. As shown in Figure 7 be

#### Network Layer
To ensure efficient access to data in the network, a DHT-based P2P storage network will be
built.P2P network: A peer-to-peer computer network is a distributed application architecture that
distributes tasks and workloads among peers. It is a form of networking or a network formed bythe peer-to-peer computing model in the application layer. In a P2P network environment, multiple computers connected to each other are in the same position. Each computer has the same
functions, and has no m
