# ðŸ‘¥ User Roles

There are five type of roles involved in the CESS ecosystem that keep the CESS network stable, secure, vibrant, and sustainable. A user can (and usually) be in more than one role. They are:

1. Community Members: They participate in CESS events, stay informed about CESS news, and join our Discord channel to engage with other community members. A key involvement lies in holding CESS tokens and participating in CESS DAO proposal voting, and thus contributing to the project governance.

    [More documentation here for our Community Members](community/README.md).

2. Storage (dApp) Users: They use the dApps built on top of CESS. For instance, they stores their personal data on DeOSS to make it publicly available and want to avoid the reliance on a centralized storage provier.

    [More documentation here for our dApp Users](user/README.md).

3. dApp Developers: They use our SDKs and APIs to build apps on top of CESS. For instance, they may want to issue new set of NFTs and decide to put the NFT assets on CESS.

    [More documentation here for our dApp Developers](developer/README.md).

4. Storage Node Validator: They run storage nodes in CESS network to provide storage space for users.

    [More documentation here for our Storage Node Validators](storage-node/README.md).

5. Consensus Node validator: They run the CESS blockchain nodes in CESS network to secure the network and participate in the blockchain consensus process.

    [More documentation here for our Consensus Node Validators](consensus-node/README.md).
