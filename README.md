**Your Data, Your Right.**

Welcome to the CESS Documentation Center.

# ðŸ—‚ Introduction

CESS is a blockchain-powered decentralized cloud storage network with native CDÂ²N, where users and creators share data on-chain, and builders can create and deploy DApps. Offering the most optimal Web3 solution for storing and retrieving high-frequency dynamic data, CESS reshapes the value distribution and circulation of data assets whilst ensuring data sovereignty and complete user privacy. Our vision is to create a secure, transparent, and high-throughput decentralized data value network. Operating as a public blockchain network with distributed storage capabilities and high-speed CDÂ²N, CESS promotes AI advancements through web3 protocols.
