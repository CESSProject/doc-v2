The CESS token is the native token in the CESS ecosystem and plays a multifaceted role：
# Transactional Utility 
Firstly, the CESS token serves as the standard medium of exchange within the CESS Network. When demand-side participants wish to purchase storage space and bandwidth resources, they interact with node operators and pay them with CESS tokens for their storage capacity and content acceleration capabilities. This is reflected in CESS’s three main business models: cloud storage space, bandwidth resources, and the AI Gap.
# Diversified Application
In addition to its use in cloud storage, bandwidth resources, and AI applications, the utility of the CESS token continues to expand alongside the development of the ecosystem. As the ecosystem thrives and the integrated marketplace is introduced, the CESS token will remain as the preferred means of transaction, demonstrating its adaptability, relevance, and potential for future integration. This opens the door to a wide range of potential use cases for CESS.
# Governance and Participation
Furthermore, as CESS progresses toward establishing its DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), the CESS token takes on an additional role in governance. Token holders have the right to propose, discuss, and vote on platform changes, ensuring that the CESS Network remains aligned with its decentralized ethos.
# Staking 
New node operators-both storage nodes and consensus nodes-who wish to contribute to the CESS ecosystem are required to stake CESS tokens as an initial commitment. This staking mechanism ensures that participants are economically aligned with the platform’s goals. Beyond symbolising commitment, the staked CESS tokens also serve as a safeguard against potential misconduct. If any node operator deviates from platform standards or engages in any form of improper behaviour, they risk having part or all of their staked CESS tokens slashed, as these tokens act as collateral.
