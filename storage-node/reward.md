This is CESS overall tokenomics:

![CESS Tokenomics](../assets/storage-node/reward/tokenomics-v1.png)

The CESS network issues a total of 10 billion tokens, **with 45% allocated as rewards for Storage Miners and 10% for Consensus Miners**.

The total token issuance is halved every four years.

# Reward

For storage nodes, rewards are only granted when the storage miner completes a random audit challenge. The reward amount depends on the prize pool for that challenge round and the storage miner's proportion of storage power across the network. After rewards are distributed, storage nodes must initiate a transaction to claim the rewards.

Origin of the prize pool:

1. A fixed quantity of coins generated by the network in each era. In the first four years, an average of 107 CESS tokens are issued per block, and this issuance amount is halved every four years.
2. When users purchase storage space, the consumed CESS tokens are replenished into the prize pool.

The reward of a storage miner is determined based on:

- *total reward*: the total reward of that round.
- *service space*: the utilized space of the storage miner.
- *idle space*: the idle space of the storage miner.
- *total storage power*: sum of all storage miner power in that round.

$$Storage Miner Power_k = \eft idle_space x 0.3\right + \left service_space x 0.7\right$$

$$Reward Order_k = Total Reward * (Storage Miner Power / Total Power)$$

Reward order is the reward for the storage miner in that round. Once the order is determined, 40% of the reward order is distributed right away, and the rest is distributed linearly in the subsequent sixty rounds, each time 1/60 of the reward.

$$Available Reward_k = (Reward Order_k x 40%) + (\sum_{t=k-59}^k Reward Order_t x 1/60)$$

A reward order will be removed after fully distributed. So a storage miner can at most receive rewards from 60 orders.

Once a miner reward is computed, it is stored in an aggregated pool to the miner to retrieve (sending a transaction). Storage miners can cumulate and retrieve the reward in one go to save the transaction fee.
