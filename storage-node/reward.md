This is CESS overall tokenomics:

The CESS network issues a total of 10 billion tokens, **with 45% allocated as rewards for Storage Miners and 10% for Consensus Miners**.

The total token issuance is halved every four years.

# Reward

For storage nodes, rewards are only granted when the storage miner completes a random audit challenge. The reward amount depends on the prize pool for that challenge round and the storage miner's proportion of storage power across the network. After rewards are distributed, storage nodes must initiate a transaction to claim the rewards.

Origin of the prize pool:

1. A fixed quantity of coins generated by the network in each era. In the first four years, an average of 107 CESS tokens are issued per block, and this issuance amount is halved every four years.
2. When users purchase storage space, the consumed CESS tokens are replenished into the prize pool.

The reward of a storage miner in $kth$ round is determined based on:

- *total reward*: the total reward across the CESS network in $kth$ round.
- *service space*: the utilized space of the storage miner in $kth$ round.
- *idle space*: the idle space of the storage miner in $kth$ round.
- *total storage power*: sum of all storage miner power in $kth$ round.

$$StoragePower_k = IdleSpace_k * 0.3 + ServiceSpace_k x 0.7$$

$$RewardOrder_k = TotalReward_k * (StoragePower_k / TotalStoragePower_k)$$

Reward order is the reward for the storage miner in that round. Once the reward is determined, 40% of the reward order is distributed right away and the rest is distributed in the subsequent sixty rounds, each time 1/60 of the remaining amount.

The available reward for a storage miner in $kth$ round is computed below:

$$Available Reward_k = (RewardOrder_k x 40%) + \sum_{t=k-59}^k \frac{RewardOrder_t}{60}$$

A reward order will be removed after fully distributed. So a storage miner can receive rewards from at most 60 orders.

Once a miner's reward is computed, it is stored in an aggregated pool. Miners need to send a transaction to retrieve the reward. They can choose to wait and retrieve the reward later in one go to save transaction fees.
